function structure_out = sort_structure(structure)
%structure_out = sort_structure(structure)
%This function sorts the entries in a
%structure in an ascending order.
%Structures within the structure are sorted
%seperately. They are put before the other
%fields. They themselves are also sorted.
%Input:     -Structure, with or without substructures
%Output:    -Structure, sorted
